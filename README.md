Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Lucas

Iâ€™m passionate about technology innovation, design, and having big challenging tasks on my to-do list. Full Stack Web Developer, who is interested in expanding their front-end skills. I have been in a JavaScript Bootcamp for four months, in which I have improved my JavaScript skills and learned React, Redux, NodeJS, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL. I consider myself to be a results-oriented, and capable worker; who is not easily affected by job stress. I am certainly receptive to take part in any company training as Iâ€™m a fast learner in any job training situation, if needed. I am confident I would be an excellent addition to your organization since user-friendly websites and applications is truly a passion of mine. Iâ€™m looking forward to working with you. If you require any further information, feel free to contact me through:
